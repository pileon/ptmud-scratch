## History

The original PTMUD started its life as a derivative of [CircleMUD](http://www.circlemud.org/), which in turn was a
derivative of [DikuMUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DikuMUD).

PTMUD was born in the spring of 1995 when the main author found out that there were MUD servers available to
download and run. It started out as a straight-forward clone of CircleMUD and trying to immitate
[GrimneMUD](http://mudstats.com/World/GrimneMUD) which was what the author and his friends were playing at the time.

During its lifetime PTMUD added many of the features that made GrimneMUD unique, but also many other features, some
that at the time didn't exist in any other MUD (that we knew of). We didn't have many players, but those we had found
PTMUD to be good (if a bit empty) and some even contributed with ideas and areas.

The original source of PTMUD is long gone, and PTMUD is now not even a footnote in the anals of MUD history.
